//One of SQLite's most notable differences is that it doesn't enforce column types.
 It will happily let us insert an integer into a TEXT column, or insert a string into a REAL column.//


Q13:
Finish this partial INSERT statement. It should insert a rectangle with a width of 'oh' and a height of 'no'. 
Many SQL databases won't allow this, but SQLite will.

exec(`CREATE TABLE rectangles (width REAL, height REAL)`);
exec(``)      // write answer.
exec(`SELECT * FROM rectangles`);
Goal:

    [{height: 'no', width: 'oh'}]


//everything inserted into a text column is converted to a string. //

Q14:
exec(`CREATE TABLE cats (name TEXT, age INTEGER)`);
exec(`INSERT INTO cats (name, age) VALUES (7, 'Catsup')`);
exec(`SELECT * FROM cats`);
Result :
